I wrote my representatives in the Indiana house of representatives again today.
I hate to beat a dead horse, but I think this is an important issue which is
being ignored. I like the fact that Citybus of Greater Lafayette provides
exemplary bus service to the area and I do not want to see that change. My 
email:

>I have been made aware that HB1001 is proposing an almost 18% decrease in the 
>funding for public transportation. I believe this is a very large funding cut 
>and should not be implemented. It will have a dramatic impact on public 
>transportation availability. With the volatility of the oil market and likely 
>gasoline price increases in the coming year due to unrest in the Middle East, 
>I foresee public transportation becoming more important to everyone in the near 
>future. Gas prices have risen from around $3.35/gal to $3.65/gal since this bill 
>was introduced, and are expected to rise as high as $3.75/gal within the next 
>few days.
>
>Cheap gas is no longer a reality for America and you must consider this when 
>voting on the public transportation budget. Public transportation is vital for 
>the people of your districts and will become increasingly more so as gasoline 
>prices continue to rise. It must be preserved! Forcing people to drive to work 
>and pay outrageous prices for gasoline will only further depress our already 
>depressed local economy.
>
>I implore you to vote NO on this legislation unless funding for public 
>transportation is kept at least at it's current levels.

For anyone in Indiana who reads this and considers public transportation 
important, I ask you to do the same.
