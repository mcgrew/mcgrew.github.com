Weight. It is becoming an increasing issue in this country. Americans are some 
of the most overweight people in the world. It's really an issue that needs to 
be solved. I don't claim to have all of the answers; it's an issue I've 
struggled with myself on and off my entire life. 

I suppose I was normally sized in grade school, though I don't really remember,
but I got a reasonable amount of exercise as a kid. My parents were very poor
when I was growing up, and as a result (and the fact that home video game
systems weren't big in the early 80's), there was nothing else to do than ride
my bike around the neighborhood all day. 

As I
entered junior high school my parents were finally able to buy me an NES. We
had also moved to a new place, and there wasn't much to do outside there, so
I began to get more sedentary. I gained weight, and I remember some of the
kids poking fun at me about it. It hurt my feelings, but I really didn't think
much of it or really care that much. 

As I entered high school I began to gain
interest in basketball, and it practically became an obsession for me. I often
played 3-4 hours a day, and my weight problems disappeared
even though I began eating more. At the beginning of my senior year of high
school, someone broke the rim on the only court near my house, and as a result
I stopped playing basketball as much. I didn't stop eating as much, however.
If you see pictures of me at the beginning and end of that school year, you can
really see the difference - I put on about 40 pounds, going from about 180 to
a hefty 220. I wasn't seriously overweight at that point, being 6ft. 1, but 
that was the real beginning of my weight problems.

Over the years since then, my weight has gone up and down, up to 240, back down
to 200 when I started working out seriously for a while, back to 220, then 240 
again. It didn't become a huge problem until I quit smoking in 2003. I worked
at a convenience store at the time. I needed something to replace the 
cigarettes, and unfortunately there was a rack of sweets right in front of me
every day.
I gained about 40 pounds in a month or two, and never really lost it. By the 
time I graduated from college in 2008, I had balooned up to about 290.

I've recently made a strong effort to fix the problem,
with decent success. I have lost 65 pounds this year, and 75 all together,
with proper diet and a lot of exercise. I currently weigh around 215 and my 
current goal weight is 195 (The CDC recommends 140-190 for somone my height;
we'll see). I've also been trying to change my eating habits so as not to have 
this problem again.

I've been reading a lot about weight management and such, and
I've become more aware of the epidemic of weight gain in this country. If
you live here, I'm sure you've heard about it, but 
[an article I read](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/trends.html) on the
CDC website really highlighted it for me. This country's health is spinning out
of control. If something doesn't intervene, I'm genuinely concerned about the
overall health of the average american. As of 2 years ago, 8 percent of the U.S.
population was diabetic. In some parts of the country that is doubled. Despite
the fact that many people like to laugh at Wilford Brimley when he talks about
"diabeetus", it is no laughing matter. It can and usually does have
devastating consequences on a person's health. The sad part is most cases of
adult onset diabetes are preventable. And it's not that hard. If you have 
excess weight, then you consume more calories than you burn. You either need
to eat less, or exercise more (or both). It sounds oversimplified, but in 
reality it's not that difficult. The difficult part is sticking to it.

The problem really stems from a combination of factors. For one, humans simply 
didn't evolve in the environment we have now. We no longer have to perform as 
much manual labor as we once did to survive. We have a lot more leisure time, 
and we tend not to use that time in activities which burn a lot of calories. 

Next, there is no shortage of food for most people today. We can eat as much as
we want and know there will always be more tomorrow. Granted, some people have
more access to food than others, but there is much less danger of starving to
death than there was a few centuries ago.

Calorie dense foods are readily accessible, cheaper, and tastier than foods
which promote good health. And we like high sugar, high fat foods. It is an
instinct which has served us well for a long time. When food was more scarce,
It helped us to survive. But as I said before, food is no longer scarce. 

There are other factors, such as the fact that we drink a lot of calories 
today. There is also inconclusive evidence that things like high fructose corn 
syrup are harder for our bodies to cope with than normal sugar. But I'll leave
things like that to the experts. Personally I've decided to avoid drinking
anything which has more than 10 calories per 8 ounce serving, with the occasional
exception of juice.

At some point we are going to have to do something about this problem. I have
tried to stop looking at food as enjoyment, and started looking at it more as
fuel. Food is nothing more than the energy and substances I need to get through
the day. I slip and forget that sometimes, but overall I'm doing pretty well.
If we are going to solve this problem for everyone, however, something more
drastic needs to be done. We need to stop our addiction to cheap, unhealthy food.
We can't survive as a society if a large percentage of our population is
unhealthy. Our health care system is already problematic, things will only get
worse if this continues.
